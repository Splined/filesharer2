# Overview

Filesharer will allow peers to upload files to managed storage, either on or off Urbit, and share files with each other. It will also allow the user to control access to his files using a whitelist of users and/or groups combined with user defined tags for each file. Integration with the %pals app will allow easy sharing with friends (mutuals).
